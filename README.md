# 🌐 Molecular Hybridization Web Demo

## 📖 Introduction  
This is a small **ReactJS web application** designed to simulate the concept of **molecular hybridization** in chemistry.  
The app allows users to input a molecular formula and displays:  
- The hybridization type (**sp, sp², sp³, …**)  
- The predicted bond angle  

The main purpose of this project is to **support the Green Chemistry course** and demonstrate the integration of **Chemistry knowledge** with **Computer Science** in learning and research.  

---

## 🚀 Features  
- Simple and user-friendly interface  
- Database of common molecules (CH₄, NH₃, H₂O, CO₂, BF₃, …)  
- Quick display of hybridization type and bond angle  
- Easy to extend with more molecules or 3D visualization
